                Guacamole is a world-famous buttery delicacy dating back all the way to the Aztec empire of the 1500s. It’s a healthy blend of ripe, mashed avocados, onions, chiles, optional tomatillos and selected seasonings such as sea salt and coriander.

                The star of this incredibly simple dish is the avocado, high in unsaturated fat, potassium, vitamins, minerals and protein, its name stemming from the Aztec ahuacatl, meaning testicle or testicle tree, which is why it was believed that it was an aphrodisiac by the Aztecs.
                
                Guacamole is sometimes prepared in the molcajete, a traditional Mexican mortar and pestle where onions, chiles, and salt are ground to a paste and added to the coarsely mashed avocados. Of course, guacamole is only as good as the avocados it is prepared with, and among the best are the nutty and creamy Hass and smooth Fuerte avocados.

                Recipe Guide <br> <br>
                At its most basic, guacamole is made by mashing a ripe avocado in a mortar and pestle with a dash of sea salt until it turns into a thick paste. However, the recipe considered traditional these days will also include additional ingredients such as onions, tomatoes (which same consider not part of the traditional recipe), lime or lemon juice, cilantro, and a spicy component in the form of chile serrano, cayenne, or jalapeño peppers. The consistency can be either smooth or chunky, depending on personal preference. It is typically served as a dip with tortilla chips or vegetables like carrots, cucumbers, and celery, but it is also equally at home in salads, atop pizzas or pasta, and is used as a condiment in burritos, burgers, tacos, and omelets.

                Grilled cheese is a classic American sandwich that is usually prepared with one or more cheese varieties that are placed between two slices of bread. The slices are buttered from the outside, and the sandwich is then shortly heated, typically in a pan or on a griddle, until the bread is golden and the cheese melts.

                Although cheese and bread were a common pairing since the early 1900s, and the French have their own, similar Croque Monsieur sandwich, grilled cheese sandwich first appeared in the United States in the 1920s, when it was prepared open-faced, as a slice of bread topped with shredded cheese.

                Bread

              You can use any bread you have on hand. Just make sure it is not sliced too thick as that will prevent the cheese from melting, 
              or too thin because there is a danger of cheese leaking out if the bread tears. 
              Also, don't make grilled cheese sandwiches with crust-on loaves of bread since that will make it harder for the cheese to melt.
Cheese

The number one rule when it comes to cheese is that it has to melt. Although American is used in the original recipe, any other high-moisture 
cheese is good to go. Some of the more popular choices include provolone cheese, Swiss-style cheeses like comté and gruyère, fontina cheese, 
and mozzarella. You should avoid dry and crumbly cheeses, or extra sharp cheeses, like feta or parmesan.
Additional Ingredients

The sky is the limit when it comes to what type of ingredients you can add to this sandwich. The more traditional ones include tomatoes, bacon, 
onions, pepper, and pickles. Apple slices, potato chips, macaroni and cheese, olives, and figs, although sound somewhat unusual, are also good 
flavor combos. Make sure that you precook, or partially cook, some of these — bacon, for example — before you add them to the sandwich. If you 
add them uncooked right at the start, they will not be ready by the time the sandwich is done.
Method

To achieve that perfect golden-brown crispy crust the bread must be buttered. Other options include spreading the bread with mayonnaise of oil.
 Alternatively, instead of bread, the cooking surface can be coated with butter and oil. It is advised to cook these sandwiches at medium-low heat.
  Also, flip them frequently and press on them from time to time to get them to brown evenly.

                Pad Thai is Thailand's national dish, a flavorful stir-fry (pad in Thai) dish consisting of rice noodles, tofu, dried shrimp, bean sprouts, and eggs. If it's made with meat, chicken and pork are some of the most popular choices. The flavors are an intricate combination of sweet, sour, and salty, with a well-balanced contrast of textures.

Pad Thai is probably one of the most popular Thai dishes abroad. Its origins can be traced to a period of nationalism in the country, after the 1932 revolution that ended the absolute monarchy. There was a public contest to find a new national noodle dish, and the winner was a Pad Thai consisting of noodles, radish, sprouts, peanuts, and eggs.

Tender rice noodles are additionally flavored with sugar, tamarind, lime juice, vinegar, and fish sauce, and the dish is traditionally served with ground red chilis, white vinegar, sugar, fresh lime wedges, and fish sauce on the side, so each consumer can garnish the meal to their preference.

                When making pad Thai, one thing to keep in mind is the careful balance of textures and flavors which are synonymous with the dish itself — the chewy and crunchy ingredients for texture, and the balance of sweet, sour, and salty, the three primary flavors of Thai cuisine. First, garlic, tofu, turnip, shallots, and radish are quickly stir-fried in a wok, after which pre-soaked rice noodles are to be incorporated. To make sure the noodle strands separate, they must be vigorously stirred, making sure they are cooked quickly and evenly. If the noodles are still hard, gradually add more water tablespoon by tablespoon. As soon as the noodles are soft and chewy, the sauce ingredients should be added — fish sauce, palm sugar, tamarind, and ground pepper. While stirring continuously, the next ingredient to be added is dried shrimp. Once all the ingredients have been well combined, check and adjust the seasoning. The noodles are then pushed aside to make room for the egg, which must be quickly scrambled into the noodles as soon as it is added. Bean sprouts and chopped chives are added at the end and stir-fried briefly, so they preserve their color and crunchy texture. The finished meal is plated and sprinkled with crushed peanuts and cracked pepper. Chives, a wedge of lime or lemon, and the remaining bean sprouts are placed on top as a garnish, and additional condiments — fish sauce, sugar, chili pepper, and salt — should always be on hand.

                Fondue is Switzerland's national dish, a melting pot of different flavors and aromas, similar to the country itself–a melting pot of people and different cultures. Its name comes from the French word fondre, meaning to melt, and it was first described in Homer's Iliad as a mixture of goat cheese, flour, and wine.

Fondue's key ingredient is cheese that is melted over a fire, with a lot of regional varieties and flavorful additions such as cherry brandy, white wine, or a sprinkle of nutmeg. It was invented out of necessity, when the alpine locals and traveling herders relied only on cheese, wine, and bread to get them through the winter.

As the summer cheese dried out and bread became stale during the winter months, the people started to melt cheese with wine and dip pieces of stale bread into it. Traditionally, fondue is prepared in a flameproof casserole called a caquelon.

The dish varies from region to region: fondue Neuchatel uses Gruyére and Emmental, fondue Vandois adds a lot of garlic, while fondue Fribourg is prepared with ripe Vacherin cheese. Pieces of bread are placed on traditional, long-handled fondue forks used for swirling the bread in cheese.

According to local customs, if one loses a piece of bread in the pot, he or she has to buy a round of drinks for everyone involved in this unique and cheesy communal affair.

                Recipe Guide <br> <br>
                INGREDIENTS <br>
1 medium clove garlic, cut in half
1 cup dry Riesling (Sennett’s favorite dry white wine for pairing with cheese)
1/4 pound Deer Creek Cheese the Stag Clothbound cheddar, grated (or substitute a similar sharp, aged cheddar)
1/4 pound Jasper Hill Farm Alpha Tolman cheese (or substitute a similar style Gruyère)
1/2 pound Reading raclette, grated (or substitute Appenzeller or Emmental)
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
1 tablespoon Calvados (optional) 
Kosher salt and freshly ground white or black pepper
Toasted bread, cubed, and/or lightly blanched vegetables for <br>
INSTRUCTIONS <br>
Rub the cut faces of garlic around the inside of a fondue pot. Add wine and heat on low until steaming. In a large bowl, evenly coat the three cheeses with cornstarch.

Maintaining low heat, add the cheese one handful at a time, stirring until almost fully melted before adding the next handful. Continue until all of the cheese is melted into the wine. You want the melted cheese to be smooth and glossy, which can take up to ten minutes of stirring. Keep your pot at a low temperature, and never bring the melted cheese to a simmer, as the cheese could break. Stir in lemon juice and Calvados, if using, until fully incorporated. Season with salt and pepper.

Keep the fondue pot warm at the table. Serve with the toasted bread cubes and crisp, blanched vegetables for dipping—or any other finger food of choice that you or your guests prefer. If the fondue begins to thicken too much over time, add a small splash of wine to thin it.
